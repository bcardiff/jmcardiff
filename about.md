# Hello and welcome.

My name is Jennifer May Cardiff, I am originally from Buenos Aires, Argentina and I currently live in San Francisco, CA.  For the last 6 years, I have been working as a professional independent photographer for renown brand agencies, museums and independent photographers shooting products, portraits, interiors, fashion and social events.

My formal education in Graphic Design and Photography allows me to work on different aesthetics without being enclosed to a unique style. I am formally trained in both analog and digital studio but you will typically find me retouching at my computer.

I love what I do and I welcome you to look at my work on this site. For any inquiries or questions please email me at [info@jmcardiff.com](mailto:info@jmcardiff.com).
